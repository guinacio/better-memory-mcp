  "long_description": "Enhanced fork of @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory that provides Claude with persistent memory across conversations using a local knowledge graph.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Knowledge Graph Storage**: Store entities with types and observations, connected by typed relations\n- **Advanced Search**: Boolean operators (+required, -excluded, \"exact phrase\"), field-specific queries (name:, type:, obs:), fuzzy matching\n- **Graph Traversal**: Find neighbors, shortest paths, and extract N-hop subgraphs\n- **Filtering**: Filter by entity type, relation type, or observation patterns\n- **Observation Search**: Search individual facts within entities for efficient fact-finding\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Remember user preferences and context across conversations\n- Track project structures, dependencies, and relationships\n- Maintain notes and observations with dated entries\n- Build semantic knowledge bases that persist locally",
